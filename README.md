# Red Enhancement Process
This the home of the Red Enhancement Process (REP). The first proposal, [REP 0](https://github.com/red/REP/blob/master/REPs/rep-0000.adoc), is an [index](https://github.com/red/REP/blob/master/REPs/rep-0000.adoc) of all the proposals. The second proposal, [REP 1](https://github.com/red/REP/blob/master/REPs/rep-0001.adoc), explains the process itself.

## Commenting on Current REPs
If you wish to make a comment on an approved REP, open an issue and refer to the REP in it.

## Wishes
In addition to provding a home for REPs, this repository is the place to make 'wishes' for features to be added, changed or removed from Red. Wishes should be raised as issues in this repository (not the red source repository).

Wishes will be reviewed using a triage process, the three outcomes being:
#### Wish granted
The issue will be closed. A new issue will be opened on the red source repo with a type.task.wish label to track the implementation of the wish.
#### Wish denied
The issue will be closed and no further action will be taken.
#### REP required
A REP will be required for any significant enhancements or changes to Red.

It should be noted that once Red has reached beta status, the number of wishes that will be granted without a REP will be noticeably lower than is the case whilst Red is still at alpha status.
